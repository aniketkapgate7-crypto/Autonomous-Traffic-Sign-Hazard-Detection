A computer vision based AI driver assistance prototype that detects road objects, estimates approximate distance, tracks objects, shows risk levels, gives voice warnings, and displays everything inside a futuristic AI Driver Assistant dashboard.

> This project is built for learning, portfolio, and academic demonstration purposes only.  
> It should not be used as a real vehicle safety system.

## Project Overview

This project combines object detection, distance estimation, object tracking, risk analysis, voice alerts, and a custom OpenCV dashboard UI.

The system uses a webcam to detect objects such as people, cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, traffic lights, and stop signs. It then estimates object distance, assigns a safety risk level, tracks the object across frames, and displays the result in a Tesla-style + Jarvis-style dashboard.
